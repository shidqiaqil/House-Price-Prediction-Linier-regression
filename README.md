# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

Welcome to my House Price Prediction project using Linear Regression. This project is a part of my data science portfolio and is designed to predict house prices based on various features using the USA Housing dataset. Whether you're a fellow data scientist, aspiring machine learning engineer, or simply interested in predicting house prices, this project will provide valuable insights into the process.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the USA Housing dataset. The dataset contains various features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. By training the model on this dataset, I aim to provide accurate house price predictions that can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "USA Housing" dataset. It contains the following columns:

- 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents in the city where the house is located.
- 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg. Age of houses in the same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg. Number of Rooms for houses in the same city.
- 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg. Number of Bedrooms for houses in the same city.
- 'Area Population': Population of the city where the house is located.
- 'Price': Price at which the house was sold.
- 'Address': Address of the house.

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook (if you prefer a Jupyter Notebook-based approach)
